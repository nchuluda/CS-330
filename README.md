How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The code in this project took a lot of patience to familiarize myself with. I had not worked 
with computer graphics or OpenGL before this course. Overall, I feel more confident in my
ability to jump into an existing API and learn my way around. Each tutorial or template 
that was used as a starting point taught me about how the API works. I was then able to piece 
together parts from each tutorial into a final project that built off each previous step.



How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
While developing this code, I would often have to make significant changes in an attempt to get multiple requirements working together.
Often these changes would completely break my code, leaving me with the task of undoing the last changes to return to a point in which the code
functions properly. Using version control really helped me to avoid these deadend points in my work developing. It was easy to bounce back to a 
point where the code can be built and executed.



How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I loved the way I developed my thinking in 3D space while completing this project. It was encouraging to be able to get through difficult points
where I felt stumped. I think the skill of perserverance will stay with me as my software development projects become increasingly complex.
